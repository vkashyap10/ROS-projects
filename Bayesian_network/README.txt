Dear Lorenzo,

Hope you are having a good day. 
My rgate got stuck last night and isn't responding since then. I have informed the IT services about it. Fortunately, I had completed my assignment before the screen froze. I have manually downloaded individual files for my ros program using the side panel and arranged them in the file structure ros requires. 

I wanted to let you know about this in case my program errors out due to some silly error that I might have made while manually downloading and arranging the files. Hopefully, in case of such an error, you would take my situation into consideration and not impose a heavy penalty.

Thank you,
Vishal
